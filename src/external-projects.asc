=== Automated Release

Put your version control in autopilot and create good looking releases.

Don't waste time on every release searching what has changed on your software or on how to build a meaningful file for each version so your clients can see what's new. Only having https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/[Node.js], you can handle all the release process in any OS. Just works!

And with the good help of https://www.docker.com/[Docker] (and Docker Compose), avoid some extra installations. Node.js will be mandatory because at the moment there is no good looking way to define Node.js path pointing to a container, and respecting cross-platform compatibility. The right path is necessary due to the Git hooks. For now, installing Node.js locally would be a better alternative.

And if you are using GitHub, make everything work on an automated way with https://travis-ci.com/[Travis-CI] (using a single file!). Everything you need to know about it will be explained in the following sections.

Now commits like `Fixed a little bug...`, `i dunno, maybe this works` or `TODO: write meaningful commit message` will all be blocked by the _conventional commits_ rules. By the way, funny suggestions from https://whatthecommit.com[this site].

=== Automated eBook creation with Asciidoctor

This project is a super simple way to create your own eBook just using https://www.docker.com[Docker] and https://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor] for it. Having docker installed, you can execute containers to handle all the files and create your .pdf, .epub, and .mobi in seconds running a single command!

It's an Open Source project free to use and modify on the way you need and want. https://github.com/rcmoutinho/ebook-with-asciidoctor[Check here the GitHub repository!]

And there is an extra. You can clone the repo and have a fully automated eBook release using GitHub and Travis CI after a couple of simple steps.
