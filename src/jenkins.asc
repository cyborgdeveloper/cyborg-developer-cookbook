== Jenkins

Automation Servers may be seen as complex and too hard to get started. But the basic automation will not take much time to be done.

There are a few key topics that will jumpstart your project automation. The first, how to install Jenkins on any platform. The second, understand the initially suggested plugins to get the best of them. The last but not least, configure your first automation.

=== Quick History

In mid-2006 or 2007, https://twitter.com/kohsukekawa/[Kohsuke Kawaguchi^] founded the project called http://hudson-ci.org/[Hudson^]. At that time he was working to Sun Microsystems. In a very brief manner, after Sun has been bought by Oracle a little turbulence happened in the community. The end of this history was a fork of the project to https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins[GitHub^]. Previously it was hosted at _java.net_. This process motivated a project naming change from Hudson to https://jenkins.io/[Jenkins^], due to Hudsonâ€™s naming rights. So if you search for Jenkins, don't get surprised if you meet Hudson information.

Nowadays, Hudson project still exists but in a corporate way and not so active. On the other hand, Jenkins is on fire with a high community acceptance and many great features always coming. And now, it is also part of the https://cd.foundation/[Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF)].

One of the key committers of the project is https://www.cloudbees.com/[CloudBees^]. They provide an enterprise version of Jenkins with commercial support. And as Chief Scientist they have Kohsuke, wise choice.
