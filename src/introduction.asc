== Introduction

Have you ever heard about the _Bus Factor_? Or the _Lottery Factor_? According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor[Wikipedia], the bus factor is a measurement of the risk resulting from information and capabilities not being shared among team members, from the phrase "in case they get hit by a bus". 

It's common on developer teams to hear the term _Hero Developer_. The only person that knows how to deploy the software and other stuff that is uncommon for the other developers on the team. Also, the one that can't go on vacations due to the tons of daily manual processes!

This book will help you and your entire team to get rid of those manual processes, have a stress-free project, and avoid having heroes on the team. Everyone deserves cool vacations!

NOTE: Most of the commands used in this book are based on Unix/Linux environments. But, considering that most of them are to start automation on Linux environments, you only need to worry about installing some specific technologies like Docker, Vagrant, or Git and get to know how to navigate over a Windows file system to get the most from all recipes.

=== Automate Your Tasks

In the upcoming sections, there are recipes to solve common problems related to daily tasks that developers need to do. Those are real use cases that you can learn and apply to your project.

So instead of just help you to start with technology, this book will show steps to solve real problems using the tech.
